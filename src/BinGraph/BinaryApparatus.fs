/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
///   <para>B2R2's CFG analyses roughly work as follows.</para>
///   <para>
///     In the very first stage, we recursively parse (and lift) binary
///     instructions starting from the given entry point. In this stage, we
///     simply follow concrete edges. Therefore we may miss indirect branches in
///     this stage, but we will handle them later. After parsing the entire
///     binary, we obtain a mapping (InstrMap) from an address to a pair of an
///     instruction and an array of LowUIR statements.
///   </para>
///   <para>
///     Next, we recursively traverse every instruction found again as we did in
///     the first stage, but in this stage, we will analyze lifted LowUIR
///     statements to figure out any internal branches (intra-instruction
///     branches). This step is important to gather all possible program points
///     (ProgramPoint), which are a jump target, i.e., a leader. The leader
///     information is stored in the LeaderPositions field.
///   </para>
///   <para>
///     While we compute the leader positions, we mark every call target
///     encountered to build both CallerMap and CalleeMap. Normally, being a
///     call target (i.e., callee) implies being a function entry. However, this
///     is not always the case. We should not always consider a callee as a
///     function. Nevertheless, our lens-based framework can provide a valid CFG
///     at any callee, which can greatly help further analyses.
///   </para>
///   <para>
///     Once BinaryApparatus is constructed, our SCFG module will then build a
///     graph based on the information found in the BinaryApparatus. The details
///     should be found in the SCFG module.
///   </para>
///   <para>
///     Now that we have obtained basic information (BinaryApparatus and SCFG)
///     to work with, we perform some post analyses to improve the information.
///     For example, we remove unnecessary edges from the SCFG by disconnecting
///     return edges from a function that termiates the process (e.g., exit
///     function), and we recover indirect branch targets to discover more
///     instructions. After the post analyses, we may or may not have an updated
///     BinaryApparatus, in which case we rerun the above steps to update our
///     SCFG (with newly found instructions, etc.). We terminate our analysis
///     when our post analayses do not bring a different BinaryApparatus.
